# FakeNewsDetection

In this project we have taken two datasets(Dataset1.csv and Dataset2.csv) from the Kaggle and one more dataset is a biased dataset(Dataset3.csv) that we have created on our own. We tried implementing various models on these dataset such as Logistics Regression, SVM, Gradient Boosting, Bidirectional LSTM, and Naive Bayes. We have made a comparison on these models and have concluded which model is efficient in flagging the news as fake or real based on the datasets present. For BiLSTM model we have used Glove Embedding technique and for rest model we have used the bag of word technique.
